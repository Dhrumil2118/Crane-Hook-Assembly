🏗️ Crane Hook Assembly – SolidWorks Project
This repository contains the Crane Hook Assembly modeled entirely in SolidWorks, including:

Complete part files

Full assembly

Rendered images

An exploded view animation to visualize internal structure

📌 Note: 2D technical drawings are not included in this version.

📁 Project Structure
Parts/ – All individual .SLDPRT files (hook, safety latch, nut, cover, pin)
